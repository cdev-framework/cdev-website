At Cdev we believe in empowering people to be able to create and share software with the world.  Traditionally, having to manage deployment and resources would take lot of time and energy, slowing down production, but Cdev takes care of all those issues for you.  The Cdev SDK makes Serverless web development simple, and we would love to show you how easy it truly is in one of our workshops!
<!-- Generally speaking, building an online application is not easy. Having to manage deployment and resources can take a lot of time and energy, slowing down production. Cdev is created with production and simple deployments in mind. Once you have your program written, it only takes one command in the terminal, and a small amount of time while you wait for the deployment to finish, and your program has a live deployment on the internet!  -->

<!-- We have set up several different workshops to help get you started using Cdev and achieve your programming goals.  In all of our workshops we will get you up and running using Cdev, you will learn the all the basic commands that you need and more depending on which workshop you choose. No matter what your experience level is or your preference of frontend, backend, or fullstack development we have an option for you!  -->
