## Introduction
{{<break 1>}}
Generally speaking, building an online application is not easy. Having to manage deployment and resources can take a big margin of your development power and slow down production. Cdev is created with production and easy deployment in mind. Once you have your development ambient setup and your program coded, it only takes one line of code and a few seconds to have your application up and running on AWS.
