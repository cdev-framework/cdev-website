Generally speaking, building an online application is not easy. Having to manage deployment and resources can take a lot of time and energy, slowing down production. Cdev is created with production and simple deployments in mind. Once you have your program written, it only takes one command in the terminal, and a small amount of time while you wait for the deployment to finish, and your program has a live deployment on the internet! 

We have set up several different workshops to help get you started using Cdev and achieve your programming goals. Check out the available options below, and also feel free to contact us to set up a personalized workshop for your school or organization.
