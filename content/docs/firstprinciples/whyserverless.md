# Why use Serverless?

{{<blockqoute>}}
“But there are still servers involved!” - Some person every time there is a discussion about serverless
{{</blockqoute>}}

### What even is Serverless?
Overtime the meaning of Serverless has become muddied. Some would say that it has always been muddy because there are in fact servers still involved with any kind of serverless offering and it is just about who manages the servers. Typically Serverless refers to services that offer abstracted versions of applications such that developers do not need to worry about creating, managing, or scaling the underlying infrastructure that the application runs on. These applications can range from databases, object/file storage, compute, and as time passes, almost any tool developers use.

Although there are cool serverless services in almost any developer tool vertical, Cdev's main focus is on improving the developer experience for serverless compute platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Functions, etc. We believe that serverless compute platforms have the potential to expand the range of viable software projects and pool of people that can develop these projects. To understand how Cdev improves the developer experience, it is important to understand the technology that came before Serverless compute platforms.
