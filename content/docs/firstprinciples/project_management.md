Cdev provides abstractions to manage `resource graphs` as `projects`.

## Projects
A `project` is a collection of different `environments` in the `cloud`.  

### Environments
An `environment` is an isolated version of the `resource graph` deployed in the `cloud`. This means that you can create an `environment` for development that will not affect the `production` environment.
