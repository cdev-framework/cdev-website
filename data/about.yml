      content: "
      Serverless development represents a foundamentally different way of creating applications, 
      which creates friction with the tools of the past. Previous development was centered around
      deploying a package that contained a set of functionality, but serverless development is 
      built around a single function being the deployment primitive. Therefor, a new set of tools
      must be created to effeciently create and deploy this new primitive.
      "
    - content: "
      The overall development of the project is focused on creating a framework that can enable both 
      independent developers and large scale teams, as we believe both are important for a healthy ecosystem.
      Cdev is currenty in an early Alpha stage, so to get early access reach out to information@cdevframework.com.

      Athough the ability to effeciently create serverless functions is important, it is not the only point
      of friction. Built ontop of the primitive abstractions provided by the framework, we plan to build an ecosystem
      of tools that reduce friction in all aspects of serverless development.
